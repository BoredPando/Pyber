#### Analysis

+ There seems to be a negative correlation between ride fare and number of rides per city. This is a high level observation and shows that as the fare price goes down, more people are willing to pay for a ride.
+ Profit (rides x average fare price) is maximized, based on the data, when ride totals are at their highest (70). This occurs, on average, when the driver count equals 50 and the average fare price is $25. 
+ Cities that had profit greater than $1500 had an average fare price of $25, average driver count of 53, and average total number of rides of 70. Cities that had less than $1000 in profit had an average fare price of $27, average driver count of 25, and average total number of rides of 18. This would suggest that lowering the price for cities with 25 drivers or less could result in better profit numbers.
